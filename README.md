# GucluConsultancy

![Website home page](https://i.postimg.cc/6QLKC9Xf/site-demo.gif)

This is the codebase of the website that I built for the my father's consultancy firm, Güçlü Foreigners Consultancy.

Initially I went with a pure MVC architecture, though later I realized that was kind of an overkill for this project. So I transitioned to Razor Pages app model to keep things simple, yet still organized.

If you have any suggestions and/or feedback on how to make this application better, please feel free to contact me.
